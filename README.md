# Kosher-Files
Java project for personal practice

Console program that checks all files in default user directory as well as subdirectory, controls the date of their creation, and if it is on Shabbat, then changes the date one day back.

Regrettably, does not work on UNIX systems as some of them do not support creation time timestamp.

In future I plan to do GUI.
